# Digital Wonderlab Tech Test

### This is a user interface for the given Survey API.

#

CLI setup:

```sh
   git clone git@github.com:shellycs50/DW-Test.git
   cd DW-Test
   npm install
   npm run dev
```

### Assumptions

I have assumed that the point of this exercise is to create a responsive, usable user interface in the given time. However, given more time, I would have a completely different maintainability focussed approach.
For example, I would want to make and encorporate more reusable components. I'd like to use server side props to separate the id input and editor pages. This way component logic can be separated as there is arguably too much going on in index.tsx
